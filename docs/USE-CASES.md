# Use Cases

Use Cases articulate how different Personas use the System-under-design. Clearly written User Stories and Acceptance Criteria enable Developers to build and deliver user value in small, testable increments.

Use Cases are typically the `I WANT TO` line of the User Story format.
Both User Story format and Acceptance Criteria are provided
as more fully-fledged examples.
You are encouraged to use both when
writing Stories in your Backlog tool of choice.

##### User Story Format

AS A [Persona](PERSONAS.md)
I WANT TO _do some action_
SO THAT I CAN _realize some user value_

##### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN _some preconditions_
WHEN _some action(s) occurs_
THEN _some expected behavior occurs_

### Persona 1

* Use Case 1
* Use Case 2
* ...

### Persona 2

* Use Case 1
* Use Case 2
* ...

... etc

By the time you get to tested, Working Software,
the System-under-design should have a number of automated test cases
for each of these Use Cases. Automated testing of specified system behavior
is a great way to help ensure quality software and a good user experience.
