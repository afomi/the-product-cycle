# The Product Cycle

The Product Cycle is a concept based on iterative blueprinting of software. Inspired by:

* Dan Brown's book Communicating Design
* Unify framework by EightShapes
* book Modular Web Design
* book, Designing Information Systems

## Assumptions

* Software is a distillation of human-thinking
* Building software is an iterative process
* Software is never done
* Teams re-create similar artifacts in most software projects, but the artifacts are ad-hoc, often created up-front, and neglected after software is shipped.
* Organizations invest resources in reverse-engineering product features for product-purposes - like Marketing and Customer Support

The Product Cycle offers a coherent way to address these issues.
