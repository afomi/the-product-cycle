# The Product Cycle

The Product Cycle is a concept based on iterative blueprinting of software. Inspired by:

* book, [Communicating Design](https://www.amazon.com/Communicating-Design-Developing-Documentation-Planning/dp/0321392353/)
* Unify framework by EightShapes
* book, [Modular Web Design](https://www.amazon.com/Modular-Web-Design-Components-Documentation/dp/0321601351/)
* book, [Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/)
* book, Designing Information Systems

## Assumptions

* Software is a distillation of human-thinking
* Building software is an iterative process
* Software is never done, because it exists in an evolving ecosystem
* Teams re-create similar artifacts in most software projects, but the artifacts are ad-hoc, often created up-front, and neglected after software is shipped
* Organizations invest resources in reverse-engineering product features for product-purposes - like Marketing, Customer Support, and Systems Architecture

The Product Cycle offers a coherent way to address these issues.
